# Normalize Values and Make Output Deterministic

Raw inputs are inconsistent; the emitted output must be canonical and reproducible.

## Checklist
- [ ] Units: convert quantities to the required representation (e.g. money as integer minor units) before writing — never leave fractional units when an integer unit is specified.
- [ ] Naming: apply the exact identifier convention specified (case folding, separator substitution, canonical category spellings); trim whitespace.
- [ ] Time: convert all timestamps to the required timezone/format; handle offset conversions that move values across day/period boundaries.
- [ ] Dedup/missing values: define how duplicates and sentinel values are treated and apply the rule consistently; report the choice.
- [ ] Ordering: sort lists deterministically by the specified keys (ascending unless told otherwise); sort object keys when required.
- [ ] Schema: emit every required header, metadata field, and companion file exactly as specified.
- [ ] Verify with an independent script: re-check counts, units, ordering, and formats against the spec before finishing.

## Pitfall
Correct totals with wrong units, casing, ordering, or missing metadata still fail validation. Re-verify the emitted artifact, not just your intermediate calculations.
