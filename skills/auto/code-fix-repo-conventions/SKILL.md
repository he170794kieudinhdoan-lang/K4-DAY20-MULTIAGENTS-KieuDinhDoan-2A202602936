# Preserve Repo Conventions and Add Required Artifacts

A bug fix must satisfy the repository's rules, not just make the visible tests pass.

## Checklist
- [ ] Never modify existing tests; add new test files instead.
- [ ] Before editing, read project config/docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, lint/test configs, changelog) for mandated conventions.
- [ ] Satisfy global style rules even when local code is inconsistent — e.g. annotate all public function parameters and return values when required. Do not cite "matching surrounding style" as a reason to skip a rule.
- [ ] Add every required artifact:
  - Regression tests: one test per fixed bug, in the specified file/name, and confirm they run and pass.
  - Changelog: one entry per fix, under the exact required heading and bullet format.
- [ ] Keep changes minimal and behavior-focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- [ ] Run the full suite and any mandated lint/format checks; verify new files land in the required locations.

## Pitfall
Statements like "I kept the existing style (no type hints)" or "I didn't touch tests" are not enough. If a rule mandates annotations, regression tests, or changelog entries, you must produce them.
